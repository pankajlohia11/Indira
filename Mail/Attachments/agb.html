        <div class="agb" style="position:relative;top:18px;width:600px;height:15px;"><strong>&sect; 1 Services of the provider, payment, contract period/termination</strong></div>

        <img src="https://contabo.com/Bilder/agb/line.gif" width="752" height="22"></div>

      <div class="agb">

        <p>(1) The scope of the individual services is based on the current service description in force at the time of placing the order.</p>

        <p>(2) If no other agreement has been expressly reached, the provider shall also be entitled to instruct expert staff or third parties to provide the services incumbent
        upon him. If active co-operation is required on the customer's part on another server, e.g. during the transfer of a web space package or other data stored on the provider's
        servers, the customer shall provide such co-operation in accordance with the provider's instructions and within the stipulated time.</p>

        <p>(3) If no other agreement has been reached the provider shall be entitled to demand payment in advance for all services ordered by the customer for the respective period.<br>
        All webhosting packages (&quot;webspace&quot;) and colocation services and domains offered by the provider (Contabo) assume a minimum service period of twelve months with an automatic extension of the agreement for twelve months.<br>
        All dedicated server packages and VPS packages offered by the provider (Contabo) assume a minimum service period selected by the customer when placing the order 
        with an automatic extension of the contract and the corresponding services for the minimum service period chosen by the customer.</p>
        
        <p>(4) Once the payment which had been made by the customer in advance for the agreed term has expired the contract is automatically terminated.</p>

		<p>(5) Given that the customer is placing the order as a private customer (as defined by &sect;  13 BGB), the following applies: The customer has to pay the provider an appropriate
		fee which equals the ratio of the services already rendered in relation to the total services initially intended for the contract, up to the point when the customer informed
		the provider about the enactment of his right of revocation regarding the contract. This is true in particular for yearly costs of ordering Internet domains. The reason for this
		is that these Internet domains are ordered individually according to the customer's wish from the responsible registry and such orders have to be paid by the provider for one year
		in advance. This is why advances rendered by the customer will be withheld, in general. Due to the installation and start of operation of the hosting services ordered by the customer
		(setup and configuration of the web space or server, the domain or the colocation space as well as the Internet uplink required, setup of upgrades, etc.), which the provider is
		contractually obligated to perform, the provider explicitly reserves the right to demand appropriate compensation for lost value if the costs for the services rendered by the provider
		in relation to the total services intended for the contract are not covered by advances made by the customer.</p>

        <p>(6) Should the provider be commissioned by the customer to provide services that are over and above the duties and responsibilities detailed in these General Terms and Conditions and in the service description (e.g. software-configuration, correction of errors or problems etc., that were not caused by the provider) the provider shall be entitled to demand adequate remuneration. In this case, a standard payment of &euro; 25.00 per 15 minute unit of work shall be agreed. The provider may vary from this payment for the benefit of the customer as he sees fit.</p>

        <p>(7) The responsibility for backups of his data lies with the customer, not the provider.</p>

        <p>(8) The provider shall be entitled to increase fees up to once per quarter. Such an increase requires the agreement of the customer. The agreement of the customer shall be given if he does not dissent within 4 weeks after receipt of the message informing him about the change. The provider is obliged to inform the customer about the repercussions of not dissenting within 4 weeks. As long as the main obligation, i.e. the obligation of payment of the basic usage-independent monthly remuneration, is not concerned, the provider determins the remuneration according to equitable discretion.</p>

        <p>(9) In case the value-added tax is increased, the provider shall be entitled to adjust the remuneration for goods and services, which are adduced or delivered within a continuing obligation, accordingly, starting at the point of time the value-added tax-change comes into effect.</p>

		<p>(10) It is agreed that payments made by the customer will not be refunded regardless of their original purpose - except in the case of an effective revocation, but then by inclusion of ยง 1(5). 
		In case the customer made a payment higher than the amount of fees being required until the end of the contract and the fees for ordered services until then, it is agreed that the balance will not forfeit.  
		Instead of a refund, the balance will be used for the provision of other / new services which the customer can order from the provider at any time.</p>

        <div class="black_text agb" style="position:relative;top:18px;width:600px;height:15px;"><strong>&sect; 2 Third party rights</strong></div>

      <img src="https://contabo.com/Bilder/agb/line.gif" width="752" height="22"></div>



      <div class="agb">

        <p>(1) The customer expressly assures that the provision and publication of web page content created either by himself and/or web pages created for him by the provider based on information provided by the customer neither infringes German law nor any other law applicable in the customer&rsquo;s country of residence, in particular copyright, data protection and competition law. The provider reserves the right to remove any pages from storage on his server that appear to be of dubious content. The provider shall immediately inform the supplier about any intended deletion of pages. The same shall apply if the provider is requested by third parties to change or delete contents of web pages because they allegedly violate third party rights.</p>

        <p>(2) The provider shall be entitled to delete any such web pages from hard disk storage on his web server if such pages are likely to infringe third party rights. He shall also be entitled to prevent access by third parties by taking any appropriate action. The provider undertakes to notify the customer immediately about any such measure. Should the customer be able to provide proof that there are no concerns regarding infringement of third party rights the provider shall make the web pages concerned available again to third parties. The customer hereby agrees to hold the provider harmless from any claims by third parties resulting from the content of materials on the customer's website(s).</p>

        <p>(3) The clauses 1 and 2 are also applicable for all other products offered by the provider which are suitable for publishing data, such as VPS or colocated servers.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <div class="black_text agb" style="position:relative;top:18px;width:600px;height:15px;"><strong>&sect; 3 Internetdomains</strong></div>

      <img src="https://contabo.com/Bilder/agb/line.gif" width="752" height="22"></div>



      <div class="agb">

        <p>(1) Should domain registration or domain hosting form part of the services offered to the customer, the provider shall act only in the capacity of mediator between the customer, DENIC, InterNIC or other domain registration authority. Agreements with such organisations have the sole purpose of governing the customer's rights and obligations.</p>

        <p>(2) The provider has no influence on the delegation of domain names. He therefore cannot warrant that the registered domain names are not subject to claims by third parties or that they are unique or permanent. This also applies to sub-domains allocated within the provider's domain.</p>

        <p>(3) If the customer should be requested by a third party to surrender a domain because it may infringe third party rights, he shall inform the provider immediately. In such cases the provider shall be entitled to surrender the Internet domain on behalf of the customer. The customer hereby agrees to hold the provider harmless from any claims by third parties resulting from disputes regarding inadmissible use of domain names.</p>

        <p>(4) The customer hereby warrants to the provider that the address information (consisting of at least his name, address, telephone number and e-mail address) provided during registration or setting up a new account is correct and complete. Should this information change then the provider must be notified immediately in writing (letter, e-mail, fax). This and under certain conditions further information, will also be used for domains ordered by the customer from the provider.</p>

      <img src="https://contabo.com/Bilder/agb/line.gif" width="752" height="22"></div>



      <div class="agb">

        <p>(1) If the provision of e-mail addresses or e-mail services forms part of the services offered by the provider, the limitations set out in &sect; 3 shall apply analogously to e-mail addresses provided for the customer. The provider reserves the right to delete the customers e-mail messages if they are not retrieved from the mail server within 4 weeks of receipt.</p>
        <p>(2) If provision of access to public discussion forums (newsgroups) forms part of the services offered by the provider the time period over which public news is stored shall depend upon operational considerations of the provider.</p>
        <p>(3) The provider shall not be responsible for the e-mail addresses he provides; their use and management is outside the control of the provider. In the case of misuse, the provider shall be entitled to suspend all or individual e-mail addresses. The customer shall be informed immediately about such measures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

      <div >

        <div class="black_text agb" style="position:relative;top:18px;width:600px;height:15px;"><strong>&sect; 5 Limitation regarding content</strong></div>

      <img src="https://contabo.com/Bilder/agb/line.gif" width="752" height="22"></div>



      <div class="agb">

        <p>(1) For webspace-packages, the following applies: The customer must ensure that his web site is designed such that the server is not excessively loaded, e.g. caused by CGI/PHP scripts requiring considerable computing power or above average memory usage. Excessive loading shall be defined as such usage of the aforementioned resources such that the operation of a Contabo server is noticeably impaired or even crashes. Contabo reserves the right to prohibit customers or third parties from accessing pages that do not comply with the aforementioned requirements.<br>
          If no other agreement has been reached, the following content is forbidden:<br>
          - Unsolicited bulk messages (spam e-mails) or web pages that are connected in some way with spamming<br>
        - All other scripts and applications that may impair and/or disrupt the function of the server</p>
        <p>(2) For dedicated, colocated and virtual servers, the following applies: If no other agreement has been reached, the following content is forbidden:<br>
          - Unsolicited bulk messages (spam e-mails) or web pages that are connected in some way with spamming<br>
          - IRCd, the service for Internet Relay Chat<br>
          - All other scripts and applications that may impair and/or disrupt the function of the server or other servers</p>
		<p>(3) Should clause 1 or 2 be applicable, the provider reserves the right to immediately suspend the webspace package or server. This course of action will also be implemented should other sites stored on the server or other servers within the network of the provider be affected by the customer's site or server. The customer shall be informed about any such suspension.</p>
        <p>(4) Moreover, the provider can proceed with the immediate suspension of any server or webspace package on which would be operated any kind of proxy service, such as VPN or TOR, for which the provider has knowledge of abuse, fraudulent or unlawful use.</p>
        <p>(5) In case of such a suspension, solely the customer, not the provider shall be accountable for infringements of contracts. In any case the provider's claim of payment of remuneration remains, for the entire contract period.</p>

        <div class="black_text agb" style="position:relative;top:18px;width:600px;height:15px;"><strong>&sect; 6 Server-administration</strong></div>

      <img src="https://contabo.com/Bilder/agb/line.gif" width="752" height="22"></div>



      <div class="agb">

        <p>The following is only applicable for server offers (like dedicated, colocated and virtual servers):<br>
          (1) The provider concedes complete and sole administration-rights on rented/colocated servers to the customer. Only the customer knows the individual administration-password of the server, not the provider. The provider is therefore unable to administrate the rented/colocated server. Hence the customer is solely and entirely responsible for administration and security of his servers, at his own expenses and risks. It is his duty to install necessary security-software and to inform himself constantly regarding security issues as well as to fix such by himself. Installation of maintenance software or other software does not absolve the customer from this duty.<br><br>
        (2) Should customers receive fixed IP-addresses, the provider reserves the right to change these when technical needs arise and to inform the customer about his new IP-address.</p>
        <p>(3) If necessary and reasonable, the customer will assist at simple configuration changes, such as entering the login-data anew, or simple changes of his systems.</p>
        <p>(4) It is the customer's duty to configure his programs in such a way that they are restarted automatically when the hardware or the operating system is restarted.</p>

        <div class="black_text agb" style="position:relative;top:18px;width:600px;height:15px;"><strong>&sect; 7 Guarantees of performance</strong></div>

      <img src="https://contabo.com/Bilder/agb/line.gif" width="752" height="22"></div>



      <div class="agb">

        <p>(1) The provider guarantees an annual mean 95%-availability of the physical connection of his webspace packages, dedicated, colocated and virtual servers. Exempted hereof are periods of time in which the servers are not reachable over the internet due to technical or other problems which do not lie within the provider's sphere of influence (force majeure, faults of third parties or of the customer).</p>
        <p>(2) The servers located in the datacenters of the provider are connected to the internet over a complex network infrastructure. Data traffic is routed over different active and passive network components (routers, switches, and other devices), which have a certain maximum data throughput. Therefore data throughput capacities can be limited for particular servers at particular points and not be equal to the maximum allowed data throughput of the respective switch-port. Unless otherwise agreed, the provider cannot give a guarantee for the amount of actually available bandwidth for individual servers, but makes available bandwidth depending on the technical capability of the datacenter, taking into account obligations towards other customers.</p>
        <p>(3) Customers can use the servers of the provider or own colocated servers for an manageable amount of different applications and use various software programms to this purpose, at their own discretion. Because of this, millions of different configurations are possible. The sheer diversity of these option does not permit the provider to give guarantees for the utilizability and compatibility of servers for a certain purpose.<br>
          Except for the specifications made in the description of the offer, the provider cannot give guarantees for the actual resources available for individual webspace packages and VPS. Rather, the provider makes available resouces depending on technical possibilities, taking into account obligations towards other customers.</p>

        <div class="black_text agb" style="position:relative;top:18px;width:600px;height:15px;"><strong>&sect; 8 Data protection</strong></div>

      <img src="https://contabo.com/Bilder/agb/line.gif" width="752" height="22"></div>



      <div class="agb">
		<p>(1) Our data protection practice is in conformity with the EU regulation 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation; GDPR), with the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) as well as with the German Telemedia Act (TMG).</p>
		<p>(2) The provider collects, processes and uses personal data of a user without prior permission insofar they are required for the contractual substantiation and processing as well as for accounting purposes. 
			Other provions for the processing and the protection of personal data on the part of the provider are stated in the <a href="https://contabo.com/data_privacy.html" target="_blank">Stipulations for data privacy</a> for the contractual relationship.</p>
        <p>(3) The provider expressly points out that the protection of data privacy for data transmission across open networks such as the Internet cannot be fully guaranteed with current technology. The customer is aware that the provider technically might be able to see the data stored by the customer on his server at any time. This depends on the ordered hosting product. Other unauthorised Internet users may also be technically able to interfere with network security and control the flow of messages.</p>
        <p>(4) The customer warrants that all information he has given to Contabo is correct and complete. Upon request the customer agrees to immediately inform Contabo of any changes and to reconfirm that the data is currently correct within 7 days of receiving any such request.<br>
          This applies in particular to:<br>
          - Name, postal address, e-mail address and telephone number of the customer,<br>
          - Name, postal address, e-mail address as well as the telephone and fax number of the technician responsible for the domain,<br>
          - Name, postal address, e-mail address as well as the telephone and fax number of the administrator of the domain<br>
          - and if the customer provides his own name server, the IP addresses of the primary and secondary name servers including the names of these servers.</p>
        <p>(5) The clauses in &sect; 8 do not affect &sect; 16(4).</p>

      <div class="agb">

        <p>The provider shall be liable for any damages caused by him or factors, servants and assignees through gross negligence or intent. In cases of violation of essential contractual obligations and slight negligence which lead to financial losses liability shall be limited to a liability insurance procured by the provider (with regard to the amount of liability) and to predictable, imminent losses (with regard to the type of liability).The limitations of liability stated above do not concern claims of the customer regarding product liability and especially do not apply for damage caused to the customer's health (or loss of life) attributable to the provider. Otherwise, liability is excluded.</p>

      <div class="agb">

        <p>The customer indemnifies the provider against all possible third party claims arising from any illegal action by the customer or from errors in the information provided by the latter. This applies in particular to copyright, data protection and competition law violations. Contabo shall not be obliged to check the customer's websites for possible legal violations.</p>

      <div class="agb">

        <p>(1) Applicable law is that of the Federal Republic of Germany.</p>
        <p>(2) Any dispute resulting from this agreement shall be referred solely to a court of competent jurisdiction at the place of business of the provider.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

      </div>



      <div >

        <div class="black_text agb" style="position:relative;top:18px;width:600px;height:15px;"><strong>&sect; 12 Payment</strong></div>

      <img src="https://contabo.com/Bilder/agb/line.gif" width="752" height="22"></div>



      <div class="agb">

        <p>(1) Provided that, in the following or preceding section(s), the customer has selected the payment option, &quot;direct debit&quot; or &quot;credit card&quot;, he herewith agrees that payments for the services of the provider shall be debited from his bank account or credit card. Such payments may include:<br>
          a) Setup charge<br>
          b) Monthly package/server/housing/bandwidth charge<br>
          c) Domain costs<br>
          d) Costs for additional traffic<br>
        e) Other costs that may arise for using the provider&rsquo;s services</p>
        <p>(2) In the case of incorrect direct debits/credit card debits (possibly caused by an overdrawn account, incorrect account data etc.) additional bank charges and increased administrative costs will arise for the provider. The provider will therefore charge a flat fee of &euro; 15.00 for an incorrect direct debit and a flat fee of &euro; 30.00 for an incorrect credit card debit.</p>
        <p>(3) In the case of a failed debit collection, the provider may immediately claim default interest fixed by law. Additionally, the provider shall be entitled to discontinue the service contract until payment is made. The provider shall be entitled to suspend the contract and reallocate the rented capacities. Data loss cannot be ruled out in this case. A one-time-fee of &euro; 30.00 is computed by the provider when re-activating the service for the customer.<br>
          In the case of a non-payment until the second date mentioned in the demand note an additional fee of &euro; 58.00 is computed for mandating a lawyer.</p>
        <p>(4) The provisions set out in paragraph 3 shall also apply in the case of non-payment if the customer has selected the payment option &quot;bank transfer&quot;, &quot;PayPal&quot;, &quot;Skrill&quot;, &quot;Western Union&quot; or a similar, comparable payment option. Delay of payment is the case when, at the first of a given month, the services of the provider have not been prepaid for the entire month.</p>

      <div class="agb">

        <p>Provided that in the following or preceding section the customer has selected a Microsoft software product (e.g. Windows Server, SQL Server etc.) for installation on his server, he must comply with the current provisions of the &quot;Microsoft Service Provider Use Rights&quot; (SPUR) and the &quot;End User License Terms&quot; (EULT) which apply within the context of the Microsoft &quot;Service Provider License Agreement&quot; to Contabo (hereinafter referred to as provider) if the customer is able to influence the use of the software or could infringe the provisions through use of the software. These provisions may be viewed at the following addresses at any time:</p>
        <p><a href="https://contabo.com/spla/SPUR.pdf">https://contabo.com/spla/SPUR.pdf</a><br><a href="https://contabo.com/spla/EULT.pdf">https://contabo.com/spla/EULT.pdf</a></p>
        <p>The customer thus agrees to comply with the corresponding provisions and is responsible for observing them correctly.<br>
          These provisions may result in only having restricted or even not having the possibility to use otherwise purchased licenses of the customer with the servers of the provider. The provider will supply a license for all customer orders of Microsoft software products considering the Microsoft Service Provider License Agreement. This license allows the monthly use of the Microsoft software product on the server and limits its utilization permission with regard to some aspects. The customer particularly must not use Microsoft products which require additional or other licenses according to SPUR or EULT. The customer is obligated to comply with all these provisions on his own and is liable for violations against this usage policy to the provider and Microsoft.</p>

      <div class="agb">

        <p>The following applies                                     for   colocation-/housing-/bandwidth-offers:<br>
(1) The   provider                                     is obliged to enable a connection to   the internet                                     and a storing position for the server   according                                     to the respective product description.</p>
        <p>(2) The   provider does                                     not provide any guarantee for hardware   damage                                     which can result, for example, from   transport                                     to the datacenter, back to the   customer or during                                     going concern. </p>
        <p>(3) The   provider grants                                     the customer access to his   server-system during                                     the office-times published on the   homepage of                                     the provider in order to allow the   customer                                     to work on the server-system. This   requires,                                     however, a written request which has   to be addressed                                     to the support-department of the   provider, at                                     least 48 hours in advance. To access   the server-system,                                     the ID Card of the customer or a   statement of                                     authority signed by the customer is   necessary.                                     During the customer's presence in the   datacenter,                                     the provider has to fulfill various   duties of                                     supervision and control. Since this   requires                                     the attendance of the provider's   personnel,                                     costs of &euro; 50.00 per started hour   incur.                                     With prior agreement, the provider can   abstain                                     from this at his sole discretion. If   the appointment                                     is not kept, the customer has to   cancel it at                                     least 2 hours in advance (if during   office hours)                                     or at least 12 hours in advance (if   outside                                     of office hours). If there is no   cancellation                                     within the stated time periods and the   appointment                                     is not kept, the customer will be   billed for                                     &euro; 30.00.</p>
        <p>(4) Reboots are   provided                                     for free by the provider at the   customer's request                                     unless stated otherwise in the product   description                                     and unless the amount of reboots per   month does                                     not create disproportional effort.</p>
        <p>(5) Other   technical support                                     services are not included with the   offer. If                                     the help of a technician is required,   costs                                     of &euro; 25.00 per started 15 minutes   incur.</p>
        <p>(6) The   provider guarantees                                     the following specifications regarding   the availability                                     of peripherals (air conditioning,   electricity):<br>
          - The data floor, on which the servers   are located,                                     is equipped with sufficient air   conditioning                                     and electricity<br>
          - The provider is responsible for   correct and                                     adequate maintenance of technical   devices of                                     the datafloor in order to guarantee   going concern<br>
          - In case of an outage /   non-availability of                                     electricity, UPS or air conditioning,   the provider                                     will immediately, at the latest during   the next                                     working day, undertake all measures   necessary                                     to restore going concern.</p>
        <p>(7) Claims   resulting                                     from operational outage of peripherals   (air                                     conditioning, electricity) can only be   asserted                                     in case of violation of the guarantees   mentioned                                     in clause 6 up to the monthly amount   for the                                     colocated server and only if the   outage has                                     been lasting for over 72 hours   (continuously,                                     without breaks). If financial losses   are claimed,                                     these have to be substantiated and   will be redeemed                                     after verification up to an amout of &euro;                                       500.00.<br>
          In case of an bandwidth-outage such   claims are                                     only valid if the guarantees regarding   bandwidth                                     made in &sect; 7 clause 1 are undercut.</p>
        <p>(8) The   provider does                                     not assume liability for damage or   loss of data.</p>
        <p>(9) The   customer is responsible                                     that the colocated equipment is   flawless so                                     that no negative impact for other   devices can                                     emanate from it.</p>
        <p>(10) The   customer is                                     liable for possible damages emanating   from the                                     server and is responsible for an   adequate insurance.</p>
        <p>(11) If the   provider                                     informs the customer immediately, at   least one                                     month in advance, that he has decided   to move                                     to a different location, each party   has a special                                     cancellation right and can cancel the   performances                                     specified in this contract that are   provided                                     in the location which will change   using written                                     form. The cancellation will come into   effect                                     on the day the location is about to   change.                                     Given that the provider has informed   the customer                                     accordingly and neither party has made   use of                                     their special cancellation right, the   contract                                     continues unchanged at the new   location. This                                     clause does not come into effect if   the reason                                     for the change of the location is an   instant                                     dismissal of the rental agreement   between the                                     provider and his lessor. In this case,   only                                     clause 12 applies.</p>
        <p>(12) The   customer is                                     aware of the fact that the provider   himself                                     has to rent the datafloor. If this   contract                                     concerns the housing and bandwidth   provided                                     in the datacenter, the contract   concerning this                                     performance ends automatically at the   point                                     of time when the rental agreement   between the                                     provider and his lessor ends by means   of an                                     instant dismissal and the provider has   been                                     unable to find a suitable new   location. The                                     provider will inform the customer   immediately.                                     Other agreements remain untouched. </p>
        <p>(13) If the   server of                                     the customer needs more electricity or   space                                     than specified in the rented offer,   additional                                     housing-modules need to be rented -   when only                                     noticed later, this change will be   retroactive.                                     The number and price of the required   additional                                     modules is specified on the homepage   of the                                     provider. </p>
        <p>(14) The   provider reserves                                     the right to adjust the price for   housing accordingly                                     to an increase of rental- additional   and electricity-expenses,                                     under the following conditions:<br>
          - The customer is informed immediately   about                                     such a change.<br>
          - The increase   takes place                                     solely in order to pass the costs   mentioned                                     above and without any intention of   enrichment<br>
          - The change takes place at the same   point of                                     time the increase takes place<br>
          - The customer has a special   cancellation right                                     for bandwidth and housing in the   affected datacenter:                                     He can cancel affected subscriptions   within                                     three months upon receipt of the   message informing                                     him about the change. This special   cancellation                                     right is valid during the mentioned   three months-period.                                     If it is not used, the contract   continues under                                     the adjusted conditions.</p>
        <p>(15) The   customer agrees                                     to the fact that the provider opens   the case                                     of the colocated server and adds a   'Web Resetter'                                     to the reset-pin of the mainboard.   Using this                                     device, the provider is able to   restart the                                     server of the customer at any time if   the customer                                     requests it. Furthermore, the customer   is able                                     to reboot the server himself using the   aforementioned                                     device if he orders the necessary   upgrade. In                                     case the server is returned to the   customer,                                     the provider will remove the 'Web   Resetter'                                     again. </p>
        <p>(16) The   customer is                                     aware of and agrees to the fact that   the provider                                     publishes (Live-)video material and   static pictures                                     of his datacenter and that these   videos/images                                     might picture equipment or servers of   the customer.</p>
        <p>(17) If the   customer                                     is in delay of payment for any   performance between                                     him and the provider, the provider has   the right                                     to keep the server and/or equipment of   the customer                                     in his posession until payment is made   in full.</p>
        <p>(18) The customer grants  the   provider a lien on colocated servers and other equipment to back claims   resulting from the contract between the provider and the customer. The   lien only expires once all debt resulting from the contract between the   provider and the customer has been paid and the contract has ended.   Starting with the inception of treaty, the customer has to inform the   provider immediately should the server not be or cease to be his   property,  be pledged or assigned. If the customer is entitled to other   rights to the colocated server, especially expectant right, he assigns   these to the provider in order to back debts resulting from the contract   between the provider and the customer.</p>
        <p>(19) The lien and the contractual   lien can also be asserted for claims resulting from former services or   other claims. </p>
        <p>(20) If the provider excercises his   lien, it shall suffice to send a written notice to the last known   address of the customer. No further notice is required.</p>
        <p>(21) Legal liens are unaffected by   these terms.</p>
        <p>(22) If the customer does not   retrieve his server / other equipment within four weeks after the   contract has ended, the provider will stock the items for a fee of &euro; 10   per item and per month.</p>
